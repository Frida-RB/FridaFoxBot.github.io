<h3> Rome, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy. </h3>
<p>The urban layout of its cities, the gestures they use, the expressions, the tourist attractions are some things why Rome is considered one of the best tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Rome, the capital of Italy, is a sprawling cosmopolitan city that boasts nearly 3,000 years of globally influential art, architecture and culture. Ancient ruins such as those of the Forum and the Colosseum evoke the power of the ancient Roman Empire. A weekend would clearly be short, so it is best to dedicate at least four days of your time to it. TRAVEL NOW! If you have a week, even better, you could even visit something in the surrounding area, but it will all depend on how much you want to see and at what pace you like to travel. </p>
          
        <h2> Some of its most important and visited attractions are: </h2>
      <ul>
      <li>  Rome Colosseum </li>
      <li>  Roman forum    </li>
      <li>  Trevi Fountain </li>    
      <li>  Rome Pantheon  </li>
      <li>  Rome lock </li>
   
      </ul>     
        
   <H3> These and many more beautiful places you could visit </H3>
